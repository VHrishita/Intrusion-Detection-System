# Intrusion Detection System (IDS) 🛡️

A machine learning-based IDS that classifies network flows as **Normal** ✅ or **Attack** ⚠️. Built with Python, scikit-learn, and Flask for quick predictions and demos.

## 🔹 Key Features
- Handles missing, infinite, and extreme values in data ⚡  
- Flask web dashboard to input flow features and get live predictions 💻  
- Demo dataset included (`data/demo_flows.csv`) with labeled Normal (0) and Attack (1) flows 📊


## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
- Python 3.8+ 🐍  
- pandas — Data handling 📝  
- scikit-learn — Model training (RandomForestClassifier) 🤖  
- joblib — Model serialization 💾  
- Flask — Web interface 🌐  
- numpy — Numerical computations 🔢

## 📌 Notes
- The project is ready to run with the included dataset.  
- Enter the flow features in the web UI to get predictions instantly.
